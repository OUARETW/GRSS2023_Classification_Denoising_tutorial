# UCMerced classification & denoising tutorial

Image Classification and Denoising: A Practical Guide

This repository contains a hands-on, easy-to-follow tutorial that provides an introduction to using Deep Learning techniques for Remote Sensing Image Classification and Denoising. 

The code explores different deep learning architectures, from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to U-NETs, and demonstrates how these can be applied to the two tasks in color images from the UCMerced dataset.
